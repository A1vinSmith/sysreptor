# Report Designer
Each pentest project needs a design which specifies how the final report looks like and what fields are available in the report and findings.

The report designer lets you customize how your final PDF reports look like.
We do not limit your report look and feel in any way and allow you to customize your reports to your needs.

A report design consists of two parts:

* HTML+VueJS template
* CSS Pring Styles

The [VueJS template language](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html){ target=_blank } is used for creating HTML.
