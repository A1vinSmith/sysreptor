SysReptor Professional (hereinafter: the Platform) is a web-based pentest reporting tool developed and operated by us, Syslifters GmbH (FN 578505v).  
Our order process is conducted by our online reseller Paddle.com. Paddle.com is the Merchant of Record for all our orders. Paddle provides all customer service inquiries and handles returns.  
These Terms of Service apply to you as a user of the Platform in the Cloud or On-Premise.
Only business clients as defined in ยง 1 of the Austrian Consumer Protection Act (Konsumentenschutzgesetz) can be customers. 

Any general terms and conditions of you shall not apply. If we have concluded any contractual agreements with you, the provisions of these Terms of Service shall take precedence over these contractual agreements.

## Internal Use and Licenses
You may use the platform for internal business operations only. These Terms of Service do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These Terms of Service do not imply any other licenses.

The source code of the Platform is distributed for On-Premise installations by us under the [SysReptor License](/license/). This license is an integral part of the Terms of Service.

## Data Access And Processing
You are responsible for the data stored on and shared over the Platform. We will not access your data stored within your Platform installation without your or your users' explicit consent, as long as we are not forced to do so due to legal reasons. However, in the Cloud, we regularly instruct your Platform installation to create encrypted backups that are stored outside your Platform installation in encrypted form.

We process your data to fulfill this service. Your data is stored on European servers under European law. We store your email address, and personal and account details that you provide us. We might also store your IP address in our web server logs and in the course of the prevention of cyber attacks.

We are allowed to contact you via email concerning the service.

We will delete your data within four weeks after the cancellation.
You have the right to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data transferability, revocation, and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection claims have otherwise been violated in any way, you have the right to complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the data protection authority, email: dsb@dsb.gv.at, web: https://www.dsb.gv.at/.

## Server Connections
On-Premise Platform installations regularly contact our servers for available software updates, user notifications and license checks. You can disable this functionality. However, you must have an active outbound internet connection during setup, license checks, and for downloading and applying software updates.

## Your Obligations
The Platform is licensed per user. You must not create more users than you licensed. Service and system users that are required for automated operational purposes (like backups, license checks, etc.) and do not have permission to log in to the Platform do not have to be licensed.

You must not use the Platform in the Cloud to endanger the functionality or operation of the software or to prevent other users' access to, or normal use of the Platform. The data storage in the Cloud is limited to 10 Gigabytes per licensed user.

As a user of the Platform, you can manage, configure and use multiple settings and functionalities of your installation. You are responsible for those aspects under your potential control. This also includes protecting account details and sensitive data (like findings, reports, etc.), limiting user access, applying user permissions following the principle of least privilege, maintaining user security awareness, setting up multi-factor authentication, conducting regular access and permission reviews, ensure availability and confidentiality of custom encryption keys, enforce and inspect your data retention policies, and creating backups.  
In the Cloud service, we create backups for you. However, you are ultimately responsible for ensuring data availability.  
For On-Premise installations, you are furthermore responsible for applying updates, ensuring that encryption of data in transit is enforced, and all web server-specific security settings are set appropriately.

## Warranty and Liability
The Platform is provided "as is" and any express or implied warranties are disclaimed.
In no event shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of the Platform, even if advised of the possibility of such damage, to the extent permitted by law.

## Technical Support
This service does not include technical support services.

## Refund Policy
You can withdraw from the contract for the reason of a mistake if the subscription was purchased within the last seven days.

## Governing Law
Austrian laws apply to the extent permitted by law. Application of the UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods, the referral standards of the IPRG, and Regulation (EC) no. 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008, on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I Regulation) is excluded.

## Severability
If a provision of these Terms of Service agreement is or becomes legally invalid or if there is any gap that needs to be filled, the validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service shall not be affected thereby. Invalid provisions shall be replaced by common consent with such provisions which come as close as possible to the intended result of the invalid provision. In the event of gaps such provision shall come into force by common consent which comes as close as possible to the intended result of these Terms of Service, should the matter have been considered in advance. Any changes of or amendments to these Terms of Service must be in writing to become effective.
